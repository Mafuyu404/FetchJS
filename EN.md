## FetchJS

**FetchJS** provides simple methods that allow you to make HTTP requests, send data, or download files directly from **KubeJS** scripts.

---

### Basic Usage

The `Fetch` method works similarly to the web-based `fetch` API.
It can be used to call APIs or send data to servers.

A common use case is for modpacks to retrieve official announcements,
or dynamically update configuration files from a GitHub repository.

```javascript
FetchJS.fetch("https://zenquotes.io/api/random", data => {
    event.player.tell(data);
});
```

The URL above returns a random quote â€” useful for testing.

---

The `Download` method is used for downloading files such as images or mods.

```javascript
FetchJS.download(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tower-of-Sighs/SmartKeyPrompts/refs/heads/master/libs/SlashBladeResharped-1.20.1-1.3.40.jar",
    "mods/SlashBladeResharped-1.20.1-1.3.40.jar",
    progress => {
        event.player.displayClientMessage(Component.literal("Downloading " + Math.round(progress * 100) + "%"), true);
    }
);
```

In this example, the method downloads the *SlashBlade* mod directly into the `mods` folder
and displays real-time download progress to the player.

Downloading images is usually faster and more practicalâ€”
please, use it responsibly. ðŸ˜„

### Advanced Usage

The examples above demonstrate the simplified usage.
For more complete control, you can use the extended versions of these methods:

```javascript
boolean fetch(String url,
              String method,
              Map<String, String> headers,
              String jsonBody,
              Map<String, String> formData,
              int timeoutMillis,
              Consumer<String> callback);

boolean download(String url, 
                 String path, 
                 Map<String, String> headers, 
                 int timeoutMillis, 
                 Consumer<Double> progressCallback);
```

You can safely pass `null` for unused parameters.
`timeoutMillis` defines the maximum time (in milliseconds) to wait before a connection fails â€”
for example, GitHubâ€™s default limit is around **20,000 ms**.

In most cases, the simplified methods should meet your needs.
The extended versions have not been deeply tested, so use them carefully.

If youâ€™re unsure how to use these parameters,
refer to the [**official Fetch API documentation**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch).

### Notes

This mod is a bit experimental â€” who knows how long itâ€™ll last.
Use it while it lives, and enjoy it while you can.
